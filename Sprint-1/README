Sprint-1 (9/17/21 -> 10/1/21):

Tasks: 

1. Organize output from spacy NER (Organizations). 
2. Cross-reference spacy organization output with crsp firm name data to 'validate' entities picked up from NER.
3. Optimize Spacy NER (text preprocessing, true-casing)
4. Analysis of Hits (parcentage of the crsp firm names that appeared accross each media network from 2012-2021)

Files:

1. spacy_match.ipynb: This script iterates through all META.NER and CORPORA data files and searches for matches between Spacy Organization Data and Firm Names (testing with crsp only). It then finds the frequency at which each entity that matched appeared in the corpora. Exports to new file with URL, HITS, and HITS FREQUENCY.
2. data_exploration.ipynb: This script is set up to be run on one file at a time. It includes everything done to match firm name data to spacy organization data from start to finish including preprocessing, merging, matching, finding frequency of each match and exporting to a new file.
3. spacy_ner.ipynb: Optimize spacy NER on the text data we are studying (text preprocessing, true-casing).
4. add_timestamps.ipynb: Script to add timestamps to each mentions of a firm in a given show for each media network.
5. hit_statistics.ipynb: Script to analyse how many companies from crsp are appearing on each show accross each news network from 2012-2021

Output Files:

A folder containing output from calling 'match_data.ipynb' and includes the hits for every media network's corpora files from 2012-2021. Naming convention is 'NETWORK/YEAR_hits.csv'. Will be used for analysis of match data. This folder also contains the outputfile from 'cleaned_firms.ipynb' named 'cleaned_firms.xlsx' that contains the preprocessed firm name data (For crsp firms only).
