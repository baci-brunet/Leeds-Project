Sprint-5 ()

Tasks:

1. Assemble a subset of firm names that are unique. Manually write regex search term for each of the terms.
2. Use the cleaned firm file of 3000 firms and regex terms to find mentions of firm names in the raw corpora files.
3. Grab context windows by timestamp (2 minutes before and 2 minutes after) and run them through a sentiment analyzer (vaderSentiment)

Files:

1. Summit_Scripts/ (Not on the github -- on Summit SC Repo): Separates the files on a yearly basis and runs them through the matching pipeline in parallel from start to finish
2. reformat.ipynb: Formats all of the output files according to sponsors request.
3. sentiment_analyzer.ipynb: Runs the context sentences through vaderSentiment and adds polarity scores to each mention in output files.

Output Files:

A folder containing all the output from matching formatted according to sponsors request.
